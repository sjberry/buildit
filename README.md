npm-buildit
===========

Buildit is a(nother) set of JS project build and test utilities for NodeJS.

I developed buildit to get accquanted with NodeJS development and to aid in the development of a few private projects I maintain and use. I'm certainly not trying to supercede any existing libraries, but my feature set gradually became more coherent and objectively useful. So I pushed the source to GitHub (here!) and NPM.

I published buildit to NPM just to test the waters and see how the package.json file worked. However **the library is not stable at all**. Don't download and use it yet unless you want to get mad at me for publishing a broken library.

I'll be rolling out improvements over the next few weeks to get buildit to a much more operable state. I also need to iterate over the library with some documentation and test cases to make sure everything is up to snuff.
